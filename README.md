## üìù General Usage for All Scripts

For all the scripts in this toolkit, follow these steps:

**1.** Save the script anywhere on your local machine, **but** It‚Äôs recommended to save the script on your local machine
in a common directory designated for all scripts. This helps avoid discrepancies in the paths specified in your 
configuration files.<br>
**2.** Run `chmod +x scriptname` to make it executable.<br>
**3.** Run `chmod 500 scriptname` to protect the script file (make it only readable).

Replace `scriptname` with the actual name of your script.
